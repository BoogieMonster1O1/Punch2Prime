Did you know that Minecraft still has pre-Beta 1.7 TNT, that explodes when you punch it? You can create it with commands by giving a block of TNT the blockstate "unstable", but you can't get it in survival. This mod uses the power of Mixins to make TNT have this blockstate by default, when placed by a player! It can be used purely server side, without needing to have it on connecting clients. This mod does not affect already existing TNT, but I might work on that...
